# Examples (WIP)

Here are a few examples of known complex kernels and how to do them. Or how to use kernels in a certain context

## Kernel Ridge Regression

Make a simple example of kernel ridge regression

## Gaussian Process Regression

Make a simple example of gaussian process regression

## Deep Kernel Learning

Put a Flux neural net in front of the kernel
cf. Wilson paper

## Kernel Selection

Create a large collection of kernels and optimize the weights
cf AISTATS 2018 paper
